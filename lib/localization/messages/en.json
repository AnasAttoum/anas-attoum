  "about-me": "I have always been fascinated by how website interfaces are created, which sparked my journey into Front-End development. I began by honing my web design skills using Figma, translating creative ideas into compelling visuals. To bring these designs to life, I focused on mastering React.js and Next.js, enabling me to build interactive and dynamic web pages. As an IT engineer, I am committed to continuously learning new technologies and techniques to enhance user experiences and create innovative, high-quality web solutions.",
